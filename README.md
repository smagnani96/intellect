# INTELLECT

![Project Icon](./icon.jpeg)

Integrative Network for Technology-Enabled Learning, Early-warning, and Continuous Training.

This project unifies the following pillars:

* *C* - Continual learning
* *K* - Knowledge distillation
* *A* - Automated feedback for incremental learning
* *E* - Early-warning system
* *D* - Anomaly detection

The project's focus is on leveraging technology and integrated networks to enable ongoing learning, early detection of anomalies, and continuous training.
